        <h2>HOW TO PLAY THE GAME</h2>
        <p>
            In the show, five MCs and one or two guest stars draw a role, among which there is one murderer and one detective. Players know who is the detective but don’t know who is the murderer. Various clues are hidden among the properties. The players should find and analyze those clues to deduce the murderer. After three rounds of searching and discussion, all players should vote one “the murderer”. 
            <ul>
            <br/><li>Alibi: Each player introduces themselves as the suspect they are portraying, gives some background information about their relationship with the victim, and describes their whereabouts before, during and after the crime.</li><br/>
<br/><li>On-Site Investigation: The players are separated into two teams, and given ten minutes to investigate the crime scene for clues. Each player is given a camera, and is allowed to take a maximum of ten pictures.</li><br/>
<br/><li>Briefing: All players present the evidence they have collected, and are allowed to ask other players questions concerning evidence. Each player voices out who they currently think is the criminal after their briefing.</li><br/>
<br/><li>First Criminal Vote: The detective is allowed to make a vote on who he/she suspects after hearing each player's briefing. The vote is made publicly to all of the players.</li><br/>
<br/><li>Additional On-Site Investigation: All the players gather at the crime scene for additional investigation and discussion. This segment is run at the same time as the 1-on-1 Interrogation.</li><br/>
<br/><li>1-on-1 Interrogation: The detective who is always innocent can summon the other players into the interrogation room for further questionings.</li><br/>
<br/><li>Final Criminal Vote: After all of the players have been interrogated, the game proceeds to the final vote. All players makes their final statement and debriefing of the case would be conducted by the Detective. 5 minutes of individual investigations would be permitted before each player secretly votes for who they think is the final criminal. The player who receives the most votes is arrested and locked in a makeshift prison. If the person is indeed the criminal, the detective receives two gold bars, and the innocent players receive one each. If the arrested person is not the criminal, the true culprit gets all the gold bars.</li><br/>

        <h2>MORE THAN A REALITY SHOW</h2>
        <p>
           This show has been very popular since season one for it is not a show just for relaxing. It is fun to watch players make jokes and laugh. It is exciting to analyze who the murderer is with players in front of the screen. More importantly, it teaches you legal knowledge through every little story, telling you law must not be violated otherwise you will receive the punishment you deserve. And this makes this show educational.

            If you have Google Chrome installed, you can try this out yourself. Click on the lightning bolt
            icon in the top right corner of your Brackets window or hit <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl + Alt + P</kbd>. When
            Live Preview is enabled on an HTML document, all linked CSS documents can be edited in real-time.
            The icon will change from gray to gold when Brackets establishes a connection to your browser.
            
            Now, place your cursor on the <!-- <img> --> tag above. Notice the blue highlight that appears
            around the image in Chrome. Next, use <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl + E</kbd> to open up the defined CSS rules.
            Try changing the size of the border from 10px to 20px or change the background
            color from "transparent" to "hotpink". If you have Brackets and your browser running side-by-side, you
            will see your changes instantly reflected in your browser. Cool, right?
